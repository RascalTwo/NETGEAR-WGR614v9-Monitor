# NETGEAR WGR614v9 Network Monitor

The NETGEAR WGR614v9 is an old router, therefore while it has network traffic information, it's in the form of network statistics:

![plain network statistics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9403665/128137734-beee8bdd-9c2f-4b34-8b94-42ff12e6fde2.png)

This is both not visually appealing, and not understandable to normal people.

***

That is what this program solves!

Give it the connection information, and you'll be presented with the same data as this network statistics table, but in human-readable formats and with a graph!
